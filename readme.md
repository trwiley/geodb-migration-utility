# geodb-migration-utility

Set of Python (2.7) scripts for migrating server geodatabases to files and back. Contains a service for the actual migration operations and two command line utilities for converting from server to file and back. More documenation is pending.

Note: use at your own risk. This was written for a specific organization, and while I've tried to make this as generic as possible you may need to tweak it for your own needs. 

Note the second: the filetodb program has not been tested at all. Again, use at your own risk.
